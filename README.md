- The parser was written with [Vaughan Pratt approach](https://web.archive.org/web/20151223215421/http://hall.org.ua/halls/wizzard/pdf/Vaughan.Pratt.TDOP.pdf) with the elm/parser package
- the project shows a use-case for how to use elm/parser lazy and loop parser. 
- you can interact with the code here: https://ellie-app.com/9CMBD6MCQXWa1
